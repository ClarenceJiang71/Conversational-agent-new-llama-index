# ðŸ¦™ðŸ§ª  Llama Lab ðŸ§¬ðŸ¦™

This is originally a repo from llama lab where it dicusses 3 projects built by llama index. But all codes are written in a very old version of Llama Index. I am interested in the conversational agent project and hope to 1. rebuild the whole demo with the current version (0.10.28) of llama index 2. adding more features into the project. Below is the original Readme from Llama-hab 

Llama Lab is a repo dedicated to building cutting-edge projects using [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index). 

LlamaIndex is an interface for LLM data augmentation. It provides easy-to-use and flexible tools to index
various types of data. At its core, it can be used to index a knowledge corpus. But it can also be used
to index tasks, and provide memory-like capabilities for any outer agent abstractions.

Here's an overview of some of the amazing projects we're exploring:
- llama_agi (a [babyagi](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi) and [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) inspired project to create/plan/and solve tasks)
- auto_llama (an [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) inspired project to search/download/query the Internet to solve user-specified tasks).

Each folder is a stand-alone project. See below for a description of each project along with usage examples.

**Contributing**: We're very open to contributions! This can include the following:
- Extending an existing project
- Create a new Llama Lab project
- Modifying capabilities in the core [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index) repo in order to support Llama Lab projects.


## Current Labs

### llama_agi (v0.1.0)

[skipped]

### auto_llama

[skipped]

### Conversational Agents

This is a fun conversational simulator between different agents. You can choose
to provide some details about the context/setting, and watch as the conversation
between different agents evolves.

A sample notebook is provided in the `convo_agents` folder. Usage:

```bash
cd convo_agents

jupyter notebook ConvoAgents.ipynb
```
